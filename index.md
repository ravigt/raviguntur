I am a big fan of small-data and low-cost machine learning. I am exploring algorithmically and computationally simple techniques to solve some detection problems involving inage signals. Here are a few projects that I am working on (outside of my regular work). Hopefully the community will find the code and proposed approaches useful. 

#### Detecting objects in Drone Images
Drone images are interesting because they give you a top-down view of the world. Most pre-trained models built using line of sight capture do not work without extensive re-training. 

[Checkout the Project](https://github.com/ravigt/Nautilus/tree/main/DroneVision).

#### Detecting microsleep patterns
This is another interesting field of work where there are many active researchers and enthusiasts working on various approaches.
