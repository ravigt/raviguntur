I am exploring algorithmically and computationally simple techniques to solve some detection problems involving image signals. The goal is to borrow ideas from one field and apply them to another field and in the process get a deeper understanding of how algorithms work. Here are a few projects that I am working on (outside of my regular work). 

#### Detecting objects in Drone Images
Drone images are interesting because they give you a top-down view of the world. Most pre-trained models built using line of sight capture do not work without extensive re-training.

#### Detecting microsleep patterns
This is another interesting field of work where there are many active researchers and enthusiasts working on various approaches.
